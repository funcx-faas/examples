    "Globus Compute is a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform for science that enables you to register functions in a cloud-hosted service and then reliably execute those functions on a remote Globus Compute endpoint. This tutorial is configured to use a tutorial endpoint hosted by the Globus Compute team. You can setup and use your own endpoint by following the [Globus Compute documentation](https://globus-compute.readthedocs.io/en/latest/endpoints.html)."

In order to use the Globus Compute service, you must first authenticate using one of hundreds of supported identity provides (e.g., your institution, ORCID, Google).  As part of the authentication process you must grant permission for Globus Compute to access your identity information (to retrieve your email address) and Globus Groups management access (to share endpoints)."

As we will see below, you may share functions with others and discover functions that are shared with you.\n",
